1.  How to build the driver without kernel source code  (we prefer this
	method)

	assume you have the source folder,just goto that folder	and type 
	"make randr=1"(For Dualview to match the x driver) or "make"(For clone mode) 
	will get you the kernel module named "ufb.ko"
	driver will be built according to the kernel version you are cu-
	rrently running. use modinfo ./ufb.ko to check it

	Note:If you are running a v2.6.32 linux and you also got v2.6.38 header
	files under "/lib/modules/2.6.38/build" folder.

2.  About the kernel module paramter of driver
	Default mode: 1024x768-16@60, clone mode.
	For lynxusb ufb  kernel modulem, the paramters are all wrapped with
	a string passed to the ufb.ko, for example:

	2.1)please add parm fbconsole and set it to 1 to allow console use the fb. The command below sets defalut mode.
	insmod ./ufb.ko fbconsole=1

	2.2)Use 1280,16bpp index color and 60 hz mode:
	insmod ./ufb.ko mode_option="1280x1024-16@60" fbconsole=1

	2.3)dual frame buffer for driver
	insmod ./ufb.ko  mode_option=”1024x768-16@60” outputs=2 fbconsole=1
	0 -- autodetect
	1 -- one output
	2 -- two outputs
	over 2 -- two outputs

	it will create fb0 and fb1 (or fb1,fb2 if fb0 already exist) under /dev
	and user can use con2fb to link fbX and ttyX
	Hint: user will get 2 screens of the same resolution only.

3.  How to use con2fb
	The executive file can display any console to specified screen.
	3.1)Compile executive file named con2fb by using command "gcc con2fb.c -o con2fb" and change it's authority by "chmod 777 ./con2fb"
	3.2)Execute it :"./con2fb [numA] [numB]".
		numA:  - means (screen info from)/dev/fb[numA]. Normally, "/dev/fb1" linked first output of SM750, "/dev/fb2" linked second.
		numB:  - means (want to show on)tty[numB]
		Please choose any number USER prefer to show the screens.
	3.3)Press "Ctrl"+"Alt"+"F[numbB]" to see the specified screen.
	3.4)Sample:
		"./con2fb 1 2"
		"./con2fb 2 3"[Dual only]
		Press "Ctrl"+"Alt"+"F2" to see first screen.
		Press "Ctrl"+"Alt"+"F3" to see second (dual if exists) screen.
