07/01/2015 Release version 4.1.5
-+===============================+-
changes:
1+.Fix runtime error of lacking "vesa_modes" on RHEL 7.

-+===============================+-
12/23/2013 Release version 4.1.4
-+===============================+-
changes:
1+.support linux kernel above 3.8.0.

-+===============================+-
10/28/2011 Release version 4.1.3
-+===============================+-
changes:
1+.use ":" to replace "," as the separator in string paramter
   e.g.  insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="noaccel:800x600:nomtrr"

Features:
1+.support dual view (on sm718/750 and sm502)
	1)insert module:
	=> insert driver on dual with default resolution
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="dual"
	=> insert driver on dual with specific resolution
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="dual,800x600-8@60,1280x1024-16@60"
	Note: after driver installed,their will be two fbX inode created under /dev folder (like fb0,fb1)

	2)link ttyX with fbX:
	use con2fb tool to link a tty with a fb node
	type "con2fb 0 1" to link tty1 with fb0
	type "con2fb 1 2" to link tty2 with fb1



Bugs:
1-.some memory size/offset given to kernel is buggy in previous version,
	which will make some major error when kernel driver	being apartner with
	upper-layer application like QT and DirectFB

2-.fix some mode error for sm750le
3-.fix a string calculating error in setup routine
4-.fix 712 hang phenomenon on x86_64 system (new issue,see below known issues #1)
5-.fix 722 2d hang issue (repeat unload and load driver module frequently will make 722 hang if 2d accel enabled)

known issues:
1+.for sm712 on x86_64 system,pci burst read calls system die,disable it when x86_64 detected
   but pci burst write (MTRR) cannot reproduce this phenomenon.

09/27/2011 Release version 4.0.3
-+===============================+-
feature add:
1.support rhel 4.3 and sles 9 (x86_64 and i386)
2.add modedb.c into source for preventing kernel panic (the panic happend in rhel4.x,which proved to be caused by null address reference from modedb)

Support Chipset
1.sm750LE

Support OS/kernel/arch:
1.support OS under x86 and x86_64: SLES 10/11

Bug fixed:
1.some common mode set failed,such as 1280x960,1152x864,fixed and cordinate the root cuase  in abuse of fb_find_mode
2.suspend/resume of sm750le failed,fixed by adding ch7301 setup in hwInit routine

Feature add:
1.add extra mode "1280x768@60"

-+===============================+-
08/11/2011
-+===============================+-
Bug fixed:
1.Fixed the bug that many standard or vesa mode can not be set,like 1280x960
2.rewrite the mode finding section of driver,to make it more smart and reliable

07/28/2011
-+===============================+-
Features added:
1.support hardware cursor for sm712/722
2.support kerne version below 2.6.30 and above 2.6.12
3.support 64bit

Bug fixed:
1.parameter passed to g_option can't handle the case like "nohwc,1280x1024-16@60"
  the mode request will get lost,driver will boot with default mode.the root cause is
  located in the string process routine,it's always wrong when nohwc is ahead of mode
  parameter.

Known issues:
1.8bpp mode will encounter bug when used by plymouth (ubuntu 10.04)
  root cause if because tty7 use by plymouth to output log message
  will alter the mode to 8bpp beneath the knowledge of plymouth
  and plymouth still draw 16/32bpp data image to frame buffer
2.cursor color of sm712/722 incorrect,won't fix due to the hardware limitation
  (712 cursor can only present 3:3:2 color)
3.disable cursor of sm712/722 by default. It can be enable by set option "usehwc".
