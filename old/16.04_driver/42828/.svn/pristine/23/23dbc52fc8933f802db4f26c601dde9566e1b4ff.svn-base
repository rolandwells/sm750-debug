1,How to build the kernel with driver source code
	assume you have a kernel source folder named "linux-2.6.30"
	and the driver folder named "electra". below are the steps:

	1.type "cp ./electra linux-2.6.30/driver/video/lynxfb -r" to
	copy driver souce code beneath kernel folder.

	Notes: 	for not picking up the wrong driver folder, be aware that
		the files under folder electra should contains
		"lynx_drv.c","lynx_hw750.c","ddk750","ddk712",etc...

	2.add below section into linux-2.6.30/driver/video/Kconfig
	( recommend to add to tail of "FB_INTEL_I2C" section):

#**********************************************************************
config FB_LYNXFB
	tristate "SMI lynx sm750/718/712/722/502 display support"
	depends on FB && PCI
	select FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT
	select FB_CFB_FILLRECT
	select FB_CFB_COPYAREA
	---help---
	  This driver supports graphic board with the siliconmotion
	  sm750/sm718/sm712/sm722/sm502. Say Y if you have such a
	  graphic board.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called lynxfb.

#***********************************************************************


	3.add below line into linux-2.6.30/driver/video/Makefile :
		obj-$(CONFIG_FB_LYNXFB)	+= lynxfb/

2,How to build the driver without kernel source code  (we prefer this
	method)

	assume you have the electra source folder,just goto that folder
	and type "make" will get you the kernel module named "lynxfb.ko"
	driver will be built according to the kernel version you are cu-
	rrently running. use modinfo ./lynxfb.ko to check it.

	*NOTE*:
	If you are running a v2.6.32 linux and you also got v2.6.38 header
	files under "/lib/modules/2.6.38/build" folder.
	You can type "make kernel=2.6.38" to build the driver based on
	the specific "2.6.38" version kernel (instead of previous method,
	which will always build the driver based on the kernel version
	you are running).

3,About the parameter of make:
	"make debug=2" will output all debug information to tty
	"make debug=1" wil output all debug information to dmesg
	"make" outputs any debug information to neither tty nor dmesg

4,About the kernel module paramter of driver
	For lynxfb kernel modulem, the paramters are all wrapped with
	a string passed to the lynxfb.ko, for example:

	4.1)Use 1280,16bpp index color and 60 hz mode:
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="1280x1024-16@60"

	4.2)Disable MTRR,Disable 2d acceleration,Disable hardware cursor,
	and use a 800x600 mode :
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="noaccel:nomtrr:nohwc:800x600"

	4.3)dual frame buffer for driver with "dual" parameter
	insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="dual:800x600:1024x768"
	it will create fb0 and fb1 (or fb1,fb2 if fb0 already exist) under /dev
	and user can use con2fb to link fbX and ttyX


	Notes:
	1)If you build the driver with built-in method, the paramter
		you edited in the grub config file will be also the
		same format as above modular method,but additionaly add
		"video=lynxfb:"
		ahead of parameters,so,it looks like:
		video=lynxfb:noaccel,1280x1024@60,otherparam,etc...
		it equal to modular method with below command:
		insmod ./lynxfb.ko g_option="noaccel:1280x1024@60:otherparm:etc..."
e.g.:
linux /vmlinuz-2.6.30 root=uuid=xxx video=lynxfb:noaccel:1024x768-32@60
linux /vmlinuz-2.6.30 root=uuid=xxx video=lynxfb:dual:1024x768-32@60:800x600-32@60


	Notes#2:if you put 800x600 into the paramter without bpp and
		refresh rate, kernel driver will defaulty use 16bpp and 60hz

	Notes#3:hardware cursor has been closed by default for SM712/SM722.
		User can enable it by use option "usehwc".

	Notes#4:The driver will use EDID to set mode by default.If it doesn't get EDID, the driver
		will set 800x600-16@60hz mode.
5,The specific driver parameter depends on chip will be explained in furture.
