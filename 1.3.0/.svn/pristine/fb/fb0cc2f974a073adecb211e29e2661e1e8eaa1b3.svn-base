1.How to build the driver without kernel source code  (we prefer this
	method)

	assume you have the source folder,just goto that folder
	and type "make" will get you the kernel module named "ufb.ko"
	driver will be built according to the kernel version you are cu-
	rrently running. use modinfo ./ufb.ko to check it

	Note:If you are running a v2.6.32 linux and you also got v2.6.38 header
	files under "/lib/modules/2.6.38/build" folder.

2.About the kernel module paramter of driver
	For lynxusb ufb  kernel modulem, the paramters are all wrapped with
	a string passed to the ufb.ko, for example:

	2.1)please add parm fbconsole and set it to 1 to allow console use the fb.
	insmod ./ufb.ko fbconsole=1

	2.2)Use 1280,16bpp index color and 60 hz mode:
	insmod ./ufb.ko mode_option="1280x1024-16@60" fbconsole=1


	2.3)dual frame buffer for driver
	insmod ./ufb.ko outputs=2 fbconsole=1
	0 -- autodetect
	1 -- one output
	2 -- two outputs
	over 2 -- two outputs

	it will create fb0 and fb1 (or fb1,fb2 if fb0 already exist) under /dev
	and user can use con2fb to link fbX and ttyX
