1.	Please always add below line to device section of xorg.conf file	
	Option "Monitor-PNL"	"Monitor0"
	Option "Monitor-CRT"	"Monitor1"
	Please remeber that "Monitor0" and "Monitor1" is the identifier of the Monitor section

2.	Option XLCD and YLCD is the panel expansion size, if both are not zero,the expansion mode is turned on 
	This will make  Panel Path only use secondary controller which means:
	A)alpha cursor is not used 
	B)Overlay is not used neither !!

3.	When DualView is FALSE,Panel path will use primary controller by default.
	But if expansion is turned on, Panel path will use secondary controller instead 

4.	TFT_TYPE only receive three available interger number:	18 or 24 or 36
	They are the TFT interface of the panel path.

5.	For sm712 hibernation feature works, please add a file named "01def"
 	to your /etc/pm/config.d/. and "01def" should include below line:
	HIBERNATION_RESUME_POST_VIDEO="yes"
